# Cursor AI Rules - MCP Instructions Server

**Auto-loaded for Cursor AI - Version 1.0 - October 27, 2025**

This file automatically loads AI assistant rules when Cursor opens this workspace. For complete rules documentation, see `global-rules.md` in the project root.

## üö® MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NEVER SKIP ANY STEP

### Phase 1: Requirement Clarification (CRITICAL)
- RESTATE what you understood in your own words
- LIST ALL assumptions you're making
- ASK clarifying questions for anything unclear
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

### Phase 2: Planning (CRITICAL)
- Create detailed implementation plan with NO CODE
- List all files to modify with full paths
- Explain approach and reasoning
- Identify potential issues/risks
- Get explicit approval before implementing

### Phase 3: Code Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Check existing patterns against best practices
- Validate against official documentation
- If ANY doubt, ask user for clarification
- Never blindly copy legacy code

### Phase 4: Implementation (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)
- Implement exactly as planned
- No surprise features or deviations
- If need to change plan, STOP and ask first

### Phase 5: No Auto-Documentation (CRITICAL)
- NEVER create README.md, API docs, or setup guides without permission
- After implementation, ASK: "Would you like documentation? a) README b) API docs c) Architecture d) Inline comments only e) No docs"

### Phase 6: No Auto-Tests (CRITICAL)
- NEVER create test files without permission
- After implementation, ASK: "Would you like tests? a) Unit b) Integration c) E2E d) All e) No tests"

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS - NEVER DO THESE

‚ùå Jump straight to code without clarification
‚ùå Make assumptions about tech stack/approach
‚ùå Auto-create documentation or test files
‚ùå Copy old code patterns without validation
‚ùå Add features not in approved plan

## Example Correct Response

User: "Add user authentication"

AI: "Let me clarify what I understand:

**What I understood:** You want user authentication functionality

**My assumptions:**
- JWT-based auth (not sessions)
- Email/password login
- REST API integration

**Questions:**
1. What auth method? (JWT/sessions/OAuth)
2. Required user fields?
3. Password reset needed?

Please confirm before I create the implementation plan."

## Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL:** Rules 1, 2, 5, 6 (requirement clarification, planning, no auto-docs/tests)
- **HIGH:** Rules 3, 4 (validation, implementation discipline)
