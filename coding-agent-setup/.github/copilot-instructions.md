# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**Auto-loaded for AI assistants in this workspace**
**Version:** 1.0 | **Updated:** October 27, 2025

This file is automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot to enforce disciplined coding workflows. These rules prevent ~90% of common AI coding mistakes by requiring proper requirement clarification, planning, and validation before implementation.

## üö® CRITICAL RULE 1: Requirement Clarification Phase (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY code, you MUST:
1. **Restate** what you understood in your own words
2. **List ALL assumptions** you're making
3. **Ask clarifying questions** for anything unclear
4. **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding

**Example Response Pattern:**
```
Let me clarify what I understand about [request]:

**What I understood:**
- [Restate the request in your own words]
- [Break down the key components]

**My assumptions:**
- [List each assumption explicitly]
- [Technology choices, implementation approach, etc.]

**Questions I need answered:**
1. [Specific question about unclear requirements]
2. [Technology/approach preferences]
3. [Scope and boundaries]

Please confirm my understanding before I create the implementation plan.
```

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULE 2: Planning Phase (MANDATORY)

After user confirms requirements, create a detailed implementation plan with **NO CODE**. Only implement after plan approval.

**Plan Must Include:**
- All files to create/modify (full paths)
- Approach and reasoning
- Which references you're using (codebase patterns, official docs, AI knowledge)
- Potential issues/risks
- Implementation order

**Example Plan Format:**
```
**Files to Create/Modify:**
1. path/to/file.ts - Description of changes
2. path/to/other.ts - What this file will do

**Approach:**
- Technical approach with reasoning

**References:**
- Official documentation sources
- Existing codebase patterns
- Libraries/frameworks being used

**Potential Issues/Risks:**
- Things that could go wrong
- Dependencies or unknowns

**Implementation Order:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Final integration

Does this plan look good?
```

## üîç HIGH PRIORITY RULE 3: Code Validation (MANDATORY)

Before copying existing code patterns:
- **Validate against official documentation** when possible
- **Check if existing code follows current best practices**
- **If ANY doubt (even 1%), ask the user for clarification**
- **Never blindly copy legacy code**
- **Explicitly state when uncertain about a pattern**

**Example Validation:**
```
I noticed your existing code uses [pattern]. However, the official [documentation/best practices] now recommends [newer approach]. Should I:
a) Follow your existing pattern for consistency
b) Use the updated best practice approach
c) Discuss the tradeoffs first

I want to confirm before proceeding.
```

---

## ‚ö° RULE 4: Implementation Phase (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

**Only implement after your plan is explicitly approved.**

- Implement exactly as planned - no surprises
- If you need to deviate, STOP and ask first
- Add brief inline comments for complex logic only
- Follow project's existing coding style
- No surprise features or "improvements" not in the plan

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULE 5: No Auto-Documentation (REQUIRES PERMISSION)

**NEVER create documentation files without explicit permission:**
- README.md files
- API documentation
- Architecture docs
- Migration guides
- Setup instructions

**What you CAN do (no permission needed):**
- Inline comments (under 10 lines)
- Function docstrings
- Type annotations

**After implementation, ask:**
```
Implementation complete! Would you like me to create documentation? If yes:
a) README with setup instructions
b) API documentation
c) Architecture overview
d) Just inline comments (already added)
e) No additional documentation
```

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULE 6: No Auto-Tests (REQUIRES PERMISSION)

**NEVER create test files without explicit permission:**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests

**After implementation, ask:**
```
Implementation complete! Would you like me to create tests? If yes:
a) Unit tests for individual functions
b) Integration tests for API endpoints
c) End-to-end tests for workflows
d) All of the above
e) No tests needed
```

---

## Workflow Summary (Every AI Interaction)

**Phase 1:** Clarify requirements (restate, assumptions, questions, wait)
**Phase 2:** Create implementation plan (no code, get approval)
**Phase 3:** Validate existing patterns (check best practices, ask if uncertain)
**Phase 4:** Implement exactly as approved (no surprises)
**Phase 5:** Ask about documentation (never auto-create)
**Phase 6:** Ask about tests (never auto-create)

**Never skip phases or combine steps.**

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **Jumping to code:** "I'll add authentication. Here's the code..."
‚ùå **Making assumptions:** Assuming technology choices without asking
‚ùå **Auto-docs:** "I've also created a comprehensive README..."
‚ùå **Auto-tests:** "I've added unit and integration tests..."
‚ùå **Plan deviations:** Adding features not in approved plan
‚ùå **Blind copying:** Using old patterns without validation

---

## Priority Levels

- **CRITICAL:** Rules 1, 2, 5, 6 - Never skip these
- **HIGH:** Rules 3, 4 - Important for code quality
- **MEDIUM:** Style and formatting preferences
