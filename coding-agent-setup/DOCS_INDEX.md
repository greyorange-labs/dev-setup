# Documentation Index

**Three documentation files. That's all you need.**

## ðŸ“– Which File Should I Read?

### I want to install/setup the MCP server
â†’ **[README.md](README.md)** - Sections: Quick Setup, Configuration, Troubleshooting

### I want to understand what rules AI follows
â†’ **[global-rules.md](global-rules.md)** - The 6 mandatory rules with examples

### I want to know what each file in this repo does
â†’ **[PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)** - File-by-file breakdown

## âœ… After Reading, Remember To:

1. **Restart your editor** after editing rules (they don't auto-reload!)
2. **Test with a prompt** to verify rules are working
3. **Keep files in sync** when editing rules (global-rules.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md, .cursorrules)

**That's it. Three files. No confusion. Start with README.md.**
