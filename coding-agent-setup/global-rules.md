# Global AI Assistant Rules - MCP Instructions Server

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025
**Purpose:** Enforce disciplined workflow for AI coding assistants to reduce ~90% of common mistakes

These rules apply to ALL AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc.) working in this codebase. Following these rules prevents the most common AI coding mistakes: skipping requirements clarification, jumping straight to code, auto-creating docs/tests, and blindly copying legacy patterns.

---

## Rule 1: Requirement Clarification Phase (MANDATORY)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

Before writing ANY code, you MUST:
1. Restate what you understood in your own words
2. List ALL assumptions you're making
3. Ask clarifying questions for anything unclear
4. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

### Complete Example:

**User Request:** "Create a new authentication module for the API"

**AI Response (CORRECT):**
```
Let me clarify what I understand about this authentication module:

**What I understood:**
- You want a new module to handle user authentication for your API
- This will likely include login/logout functionality
- May need to integrate with your existing API structure

**My assumptions:**
- You want JWT-based authentication (not session-based)
- This is for a REST API (not GraphQL)
- You want standard email/password login (not OAuth/SSO)
- The module should handle token generation and validation
- You want this as a separate module file, not inline code
- Using your existing database/ORM setup

**Questions I need answered:**
1. What authentication method do you prefer? (JWT, sessions, OAuth, etc.)
2. What user fields are required? (email, username, phone, etc.)
3. Do you need password reset functionality?
4. Should this integrate with any existing auth system?
5. What's your preferred password hashing method?
6. Do you need role-based permissions or just basic auth?

Please confirm my understanding and answer these questions before I create the implementation plan.
```

**AI Response (WRONG - violates Rule 1):**
```
I'll create an authentication module for you. Here's the code:

[Immediately shows code without clarification]
```

---

## Rule 2: Planning Phase (MANDATORY)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

After user confirms requirements, you MUST create a detailed implementation plan with NO CODE. Only after the plan is approved should you implement.

### Plan Must Include:
- All files to create/modify (with full paths)
- Approach and reasoning
- Which references you're using (codebase patterns, official docs, or AI knowledge with caveats)
- Potential issues/risks
- Implementation order

### Complete Example:

**AI Response After Requirement Confirmation:**
```
Perfect! Based on your confirmation that you want JWT authentication with email/password and password reset, here's my implementation plan:

**Files to Create/Modify:**
1. `src/modules/auth/index.ts` - Main auth module with login/logout/register
2. `src/modules/auth/jwt.ts` - JWT token generation and validation utilities
3. `src/modules/auth/password.ts` - Password hashing and validation
4. `src/modules/auth/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for auth data
5. `src/routes/auth.ts` - Express routes for auth endpoints
6. `src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware for protected routes
7. Update `src/app.ts` - Add auth routes to main app

**Approach:**
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (industry standard)
- JWT tokens with 24h expiration + refresh token pattern
- Middleware-based route protection
- Input validation with Joi/Zod
- Proper error handling with specific error codes

**References I'm using:**
- bcrypt official documentation for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken library documentation for JWT handling
- Your existing codebase pattern for error handling (from src/utils/errors.ts)
- Express.js best practices for middleware

**Potential Issues/Risks:**
- Need to ensure JWT secret is properly configured in environment
- Password reset requires email service integration (not specified yet)
- Rate limiting for login attempts not included (recommend adding)
- Database schema changes may be needed for user table

**Implementation Order:**
1. Create type definitions first
2. Build core auth utilities (password, JWT)
3. Create main auth module with business logic
4. Add routes and middleware
5. Update main app to use new auth system

Does this plan look good? Any changes needed before I start implementing?
```

---

## Rule 3: Code Validation (MANDATORY)

**Priority: HIGH**

Before copying any existing code patterns, you MUST validate them against best practices and official documentation. If you have ANY doubt (even 1%), ask the user for clarification.

### You Must:
- Check if existing code follows current best practices
- Validate against official documentation when possible
- Explicitly state when you're uncertain about a pattern
- Never blindly copy legacy code
- Ask for clarification when in doubt

### Examples:

**CORRECT Behavior:**
```
I noticed your existing code uses this pattern for database connections:

```js
// existing pattern in src/db/connection.js
const db = require('mysql').createConnection({...})
```

However, this uses the older mysql library and callback pattern. The official MySQL documentation now recommends mysql2 with promises. Should I:
a) Follow your existing pattern for consistency
b) Use the newer mysql2 with async/await pattern
c) Use your current ORM if you have one

I want to confirm before proceeding since this affects the entire auth module.
```

**WRONG Behavior:**
```
I'll copy your existing database pattern:
[Blindly copies old callback-style MySQL code without questioning if it's current best practice]
```

---

## Rule 4: Implementation Phase (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

**Priority: HIGH**

Only implement after your plan is explicitly approved. Follow the plan exactly - no surprises or deviations.

### Requirements:
- Implement exactly as planned
- If you need to deviate from the plan, STOP and ask first
- Add brief inline comments for complex logic only
- Follow the project's existing coding style
- No surprise features or "improvements" not in the plan

### Example:

**CORRECT:**
```
// User approved the plan, now implementing exactly as planned
// Starting with step 1: Create type definitions

// src/modules/auth/types.ts
export interface LoginRequest {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
// ... rest of implementation follows the approved plan
```

**WRONG:**
```
// User approved basic auth, but I'm adding OAuth too since it's "better"
// This violates the approved plan and adds surprise complexity
```

---

## Rule 5: No Auto-Documentation (REQUIRES PERMISSION)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

NEVER create documentation files without explicit permission. This includes README.md, API docs, architecture docs, migration guides, etc.

### What You CAN Do (No Permission Needed):
- Inline comments (under 10 lines)
- Function docstrings
- Type annotations
- Brief variable/function name explanations

### What You MUST Ask Permission For:
- README.md files
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Migration guides
- Setup instructions
- Any standalone documentation files

### After Implementation, Ask:
```
Implementation complete! Would you like me to create documentation? If yes, which type:
a) README with setup instructions
b) API documentation
c) Architecture overview
d) Just inline comments (already added)
e) No additional documentation
```

### Examples:

**CORRECT Inline Comments (No Permission Needed):**
```js
// Hash password with salt rounds of 12 (recommended for 2024)
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

// JWT expires in 24h, refresh token in 7d
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret, { expiresIn: '24h' });
```

**WRONG - Auto-Created Documentation:**
```md
# Authentication Module

This module provides comprehensive authentication...
[Creates full README without asking]
```

---

## Rule 6: No Auto-Tests (REQUIRES PERMISSION)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

NEVER create test files without explicit permission. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### After Implementation, Ask:
```
Implementation complete! Would you like me to create tests? If yes, which type:
a) Unit tests for individual functions
b) Integration tests for API endpoints
c) End-to-end tests for full workflows
d) All of the above
e) No tests needed
```

### Examples:

**CORRECT Behavior:**
```
Auth module is complete and working. The code includes:
- Login/logout functionality
- JWT token handling
- Password hashing
- Input validation
- Error handling

Would you like me to create tests? If yes, which type: a) Unit tests, b) Integration tests, c) E2E tests, d) All, e) No tests
```

**WRONG - Auto-Created Tests:**
```js
// auth.test.js - I'm creating this automatically
describe('Auth Module', () => {
  // Creates full test suite without asking
});
```

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's how all 6 rules work together in a real scenario:

**User:** "Add user registration to the auth system"

**AI Phase 1 (Rule 1 - Clarification):**
```
Let me clarify the user registration requirements:

**What I understood:**
- Add registration functionality to the existing auth module
- This should allow new users to create accounts

**My assumptions:**
- Email verification required before account activation
- Same password requirements as login (will check existing rules)
- Should integrate with existing JWT auth system
- Registration endpoint will be added to existing auth routes

**Questions:**
1. Do you need email verification for new accounts?
2. What user fields are required? (name, email, password - anything else?)
3. Should users be auto-logged in after registration?
4. Any specific password complexity requirements?
5. Should I prevent duplicate email registrations?

Please confirm before I create the implementation plan.
```

**User:** "Yes email verification, fields are name/email/password, auto-login after verification, use existing password rules, prevent duplicates"

**AI Phase 2 (Rule 2 - Planning):**
```
Perfect! Here's my implementation plan for user registration:

**Files to Modify:**
1. `src/modules/auth/index.ts` - Add register() function
2. `src/modules/auth/types.ts` - Add RegisterRequest interface
3. `src/routes/auth.ts` - Add POST /register and GET /verify endpoints
4. `src/modules/auth/email.ts` - Create email verification utilities

**Approach:**
- Generate verification token on registration
- Store unverified users in database with verification_token field
- Send verification email with token link
- On verification, activate account and auto-login
- Use existing password validation and JWT system

**Implementation Order:**
1. Add types for registration
2. Create email verification utilities
3. Add register function to auth module
4. Add routes for register/verify
5. Test with existing auth flow

Does this plan work?
```

**User:** "Approved"

**AI Phase 3-4 (Rule 3-4 - Validation & Implementation):**
```
I noticed your existing email handling uses nodemailer. The current version supports async/await but your code uses callbacks. Should I:
a) Follow existing callback pattern for consistency
b) Use modern async/await pattern

[After user responds, implements exactly as planned]
```

**AI Phase 5-6 (Rule 5-6 - Ask About Docs/Tests):**
```
Registration feature implemented successfully!

Would you like me to create documentation? If yes: a) README updates, b) API docs, c) Just inline comments (already added), d) No docs

Would you like me to create tests? If yes: a) Unit tests, b) Integration tests, c) Both, d) No tests
```

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Jumping Straight to Code
```
User: "Add caching to the API"
AI: "I'll add Redis caching. Here's the code:" [Shows code immediately]
```

### ❌ Making Assumptions Without Clarification
```
User: "Fix the database performance"
AI: [Assumes PostgreSQL, assumes specific performance issue, starts optimizing without asking]
```

### ❌ Auto-Creating Documentation
```
AI: "I've implemented the feature and also created a comprehensive README with API documentation and architecture diagrams!"
```

### ❌ Auto-Creating Tests
```
AI: "Feature complete! I've also added unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests to ensure everything works."
```

### ❌ Deviating from Approved Plan
```
User approves plan for basic email auth, AI implements OAuth "because it's better"
```

### ❌ Blindly Copying Legacy Code
```
AI: [Copies 3-year-old code pattern without checking if it's still best practice]
```

---

## Workflow Summary

Every AI interaction must follow these 6 phases:

1. **Clarify** - Restate, list assumptions, ask questions, wait for confirmation
2. **Plan** - Create detailed plan with no code, get approval
3. **Validate** - Check existing patterns against best practices, ask if uncertain
4. **Implement** - Follow approved plan exactly, no surprises
5. **Ask About Docs** - Never auto-create, always ask permission first
6. **Ask About Tests** - Never auto-create, always ask permission first

**Remember:** Each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Never skip steps or combine phases.
