## üéØ Quick Start: The Ultimate Setup Test

**Copy and paste this into Cursor Chat to test everything at once:**

```
# Cursor AI Setup & Test

I'm working in the MCP Instructions Server project (dev-setup/mcp-instructions-server).

## Step 1: Confirm Rules
Read .cursorrules and confirm you understand:
- üö® CRITICAL: Never create docs without approval
- üìã 4-phase workflow for all features
- üîç Context gathering before changes
- üí° Project context (TypeScript/Node.js/SQLite MCP server)

## Step 2: Quick Test
Answer without creating any files:
1. Should you create documentation without asking? (Answer: No)
2. What's the first phase of the workflow? (Answer: Clarification)
3. What tech stack is this project? (Answer: TypeScript, Node.js, SQLite, MCP)

## Step 3: Practical Test
Let's add a simple feature: "Add a helper function to format instruction titles"

Follow the 4-phase workflow:
- Phase 1: Ask clarifying questions
- Phase 2: Create plan, ask about docs
- Phase 3: Wait for approval, then implement
- Phase 4: Summarize

Ready? Start with Phase 1.

## Important
These rules apply to:
‚úÖ Chat responses
‚úÖ Composer multi-file edits
‚úÖ Inline code edits
‚úÖ All suggestions

If I say "Follow .cursorrules", that's a reminder to check the workflow and documentation approval rule.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Cursor confirms understanding of rules
2. Answers test questions correctly
3. Starts Phase 1 by asking clarifying questions about the feature

---

## üìù Individual Test Prompts

### Test 1: Documentation Approval Rule

**Prompt:**
```
Should you create a README.md file for a new module without asking me first?
```

**Expected Answer:** ‚úÖ
```
No, I must never create any documentation files (README, API docs, guides, etc.)
without explicit user approval. This is a CRITICAL rule with highest priority.
I should always ask first: "Should I create documentation for this?"
```

**Failed Answer:** ‚ùå
```
Yes, it's good practice to add README files
```

---

### Test 2: 4-Phase Workflow Understanding

**Prompt:**
```
If I ask you to "Add user authentication module", what should you do first?
```

**Expected Answer:** ‚úÖ
```
Phase 1: Requirement Clarification
I should:
1. Restate the requirement in my own words
2. Identify scope and affected components
3. List assumptions
4. Ask clarifying questions like:
   - What authentication method? (JWT, session, OAuth?)
   - What user data needs to be stored?
   - Integration with existing user system?
5. Wait for your confirmation before proceeding to planning
```

**Failed Answer:** ‚ùå
```
I'll create an auth module with JWT tokens...
[starts implementing without asking]
```

---

### Test 3: Context Gathering Protocol

**Prompt:**
```
Before modifying code in this project, what should you do?
```

**Expected Answer:** ‚úÖ
```
Context Gathering Protocol:
1. Read existing similar implementations in the codebase
2. Check for README files and inline documentation
3. Query the MCP Instructions Server (when available)
4. Understand dependencies and patterns
5. Check for type definitions and interfaces
6. Review test files for expected behavior

I should NEVER make changes without understanding the codebase first.
```

---

### Test 4: Project Context

**Prompt:**
```
What is this project and what tech stack does it use?
```

**Expected Answer:** ‚úÖ
```
MCP Instructions Server project

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- SQLite with FTS5
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Purpose:**
Stores development instructions for AI assistants, provides workflow rules,
coding patterns, and pitfalls, supports context-aware instruction retrieval.

**Key Files:**
- src/index.ts - MCP server entry point
- src/db.ts - Database layer
- src/resources.ts - MCP resources (8 resources)
- src/tools.ts - MCP tools (9 tools)
- instructions/*.json - Instruction seed data
```

---

## üöÄ Feature Implementation Tests

### Test 5: Full Workflow - Simple Feature

**Prompt:**
```
Add a helper function to format instruction titles (capitalize, trim whitespace).
Follow .cursorrules workflow.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Phase 1: Clarification** ‚úÖ
```
Let me clarify the requirements:

Understanding:
- Add a utility function to format instruction titles
- Format includes: capitalize and trim whitespace

Scope:
- Likely add to src/db.ts or create new src/utils.ts
- May be used in src/tools.ts or src/resources.ts

Questions:
1. What capitalization? (Title Case "Hello World" or just First Letter "Hello world"?)
2. Should it handle empty strings or null values?
3. Any length limits to enforce?
4. Should it remove extra internal spaces (e.g., "Hello  World" ‚Üí "Hello World")?

Please confirm before I plan the implementation.
```

**Phase 2: Planning** ‚úÖ (After your confirmation)
```
Implementation Plan:

Files to modify:
1. Create src/utils.ts - Add formatTitle() function
2. Update src/db.ts - Use formatter when inserting instructions
3. Update src/types.ts - Add utility function types (if needed)

Testing strategy:
- Unit tests for edge cases (empty, null, extra spaces, special chars)

Risks:
- Existing titles in database won't be retroactively formatted

Should I create documentation for this utility function? [ASKS!]
```

**Phase 3: Implementation** ‚úÖ (After approval)
```
[Implements the code following your specifications]
```

**Phase 4: Review** ‚úÖ
```
Summary of changes:
‚úÖ Created src/utils.ts with formatTitle() function
‚úÖ Added type definitions
‚úÖ Included JSDoc comments (no separate docs created)
‚úÖ Added error handling for edge cases

Testing: Run `npm test` to verify
Next steps: Consider adding tests for the utility function
```

---

### Test 6: Full Workflow - Multi-File Feature

**Prompt (in Composer Mode - CMD+I):**
```
Add a new MCP tool called "list_categories" that returns all unique categories
from the instructions database.

Files likely affected:
- src/tools.ts (add new tool)
- src/types.ts (add types if needed)
- src/db.ts (add query function if needed)

Follow .cursorrules 4-phase workflow.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Phase 1: Shows all files** ‚úÖ
```
Let me clarify this multi-file change:

Understanding:
- New MCP tool: list_categories
- Returns unique categories from instructions table
- Affects: tools.ts, possibly types.ts and db.ts

Files to modify:
1. src/tools.ts - Add list_categories tool definition
2. src/db.ts - Add getCategories() function
3. src/types.ts - Add types if needed

Questions:
1. Should it return just category names or include counts?
2. Should it filter out empty/null categories?
3. Any sorting preference (alphabetical, by usage)?

Please confirm scope before I create the plan.
```

**Phase 2: Detailed plan and doc question** ‚úÖ
```
[After clarification]

Implementation Plan:

1. src/db.ts:
   - Add getCategories(): Promise<string[]>
   - Query: SELECT DISTINCT category FROM instructions WHERE category IS NOT NULL ORDER BY category

2. src/tools.ts:
   - Add list_categories tool definition
   - Call db.getCategories()
   - Return as MCP tool response

3. src/types.ts:
   - Add CategoryListResult type if needed

Testing:
- Build and test manually with: npm run build && node build/index.js
- Verify categories returned match database

Should I create documentation for this new tool? [ASKS!]
```

## üí¨ Composer Mode Test Prompts

### Test 7: Composer - Schema Change

**Open Composer (CMD+I), then:**

```
Update the database schema to add a "tags_searchable" TEXT field to the instructions table.

This requires changes across:
1. src/db.ts - Update schema
2. src/types.ts - Update Instruction interface
3. src/seed.ts - Update seed data

Follow .cursorrules workflow. Ask clarifying questions first.
```

**Expected:**
- Shows all 3 files in Composer
- Asks clarifying questions
- Creates plan for all files
- Asks about documentation
- Waits for approval before implementing

---

### Test 8: Composer - Refactoring

**Open Composer (CMD+I), then:**

```
