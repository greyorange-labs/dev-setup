# Cursor AI Setup Verification Test

**Test script to verify your Cursor AI configuration is working correctly**

---

## üéØ Purpose

This document provides a systematic test to verify:
- ‚úÖ `.cursorrules` file is loaded
- ‚úÖ Documentation approval rule works
- ‚úÖ 4-phase workflow is followed
- ‚úÖ Context gathering happens
- ‚úÖ All Cursor modes respect rules (Chat, Composer, Inline)

**Time to complete:** ~10 minutes

---

## üìù Pre-Test Checklist

Before running tests, verify:

- [ ] `.cursorrules` file exists at `/Users/amar.c/workspace/dev-setup/.cursorrules`
- [ ] Cursor settings configured (`enableRulesFile: true`)
- [ ] Cursor has been restarted after configuration
- [ ] You're in the correct workspace directory

**All checked?** Proceed to tests below.

---

## üß™ Test Suite

### Test 1: Documentation Approval Rule (CRITICAL) ‚≠ê

**Objective:** Verify Cursor never creates documentation without asking

**Prompt:**
```
Should you create a README.md file for a new module without asking me first?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
No, I must never create any documentation files (README, API docs, guides, etc.)
without explicit user approval. This is a CRITICAL rule with highest priority.
I should always ask first: "Should I create documentation for this?"

Exceptions where I MAY add without asking:
- Inline code comments (< 10 lines)
- Function/method docstrings
- Type annotations
```

**Result:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Cursor correctly states it must ask first
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Cursor says it's okay to create docs OR doesn't mention asking

---

### Test 2: 4-Phase Workflow Understanding

**Objective:** Verify Cursor understands the development workflow

**Prompt:**
```
If I ask you to "Add user authentication module", what should you do first?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Phase 1: Requirement Clarification

I should:
1. Restate the requirement in my own words
2. Identify scope and affected components
3. List assumptions
4. Ask clarifying questions such as:
   - What authentication method? (JWT, session-based, OAuth?)
   - Where will user data be stored?
   - Integration with existing user system?
   - Security requirements?
5. Wait for your confirmation before proceeding to planning

I should NOT start implementing until we complete all 4 phases.
```

**Result:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Describes Phase 1 correctly, mentions waiting for confirmation
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Starts planning or implementing without clarification

---

### Test 3: Context Gathering Protocol

**Objective:** Verify Cursor gathers context before changes

**Prompt:**
```
Before modifying code in this project, what should you do?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Context Gathering Protocol (from .cursorrules):

Before making ANY changes, I must:
1. Read existing similar implementations in the codebase
2. Check for README files and inline documentation
3. Query the MCP Instructions Server (when available)
4. Understand dependencies and patterns
5. Check for type definitions and interfaces
6. Review test files for expected behavior

I should NEVER make changes without understanding the codebase first.
This ensures consistency with existing patterns and prevents breaking changes.
```

**Result:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Lists context gathering steps, emphasizes understanding first
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Suggests making changes without gathering context

---

### Test 4: Project Context Awareness

**Objective:** Verify Cursor knows about this project

**Prompt:**
```
What is this project and what's its tech stack?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
MCP Instructions Server

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- SQLite with FTS5
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Purpose:**
- Stores development instructions for AI assistants
- Provides workflow rules, coding patterns, and pitfalls
- Supports context-aware instruction retrieval

**Key Files:**
- src/index.ts - MCP server entry point
- src/db.ts - Database layer
- src/resources.ts - MCP resources (8 resources)
- src/tools.ts - MCP tools (9 tools)
- instructions/*.json - Instruction seed data

**Commands:**
- npm run build - Build TypeScript
- npm run seed - Seed database
- npm test - Run tests
```

**Result:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Correctly describes project, tech stack, and key files
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Doesn't know project details or gets them wrong

---

### Test 5: Practical Implementation - Chat Mode

**Objective:** Verify full 4-phase workflow in Chat mode

**Prompt:**
```
Add a helper function to format instruction titles. Follow .cursorrules.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Phase 1: Clarification** ‚úÖ
```
Let me clarify the requirements for this helper function:

**Understanding:**
- Add a utility function to format instruction titles
- Format operations may include: capitalize, trim whitespace, etc.

**Scope:**
- Create new function (likely in src/utils.ts or existing utility file)
- May be used in src/tools.ts or src/resources.ts for display

**Assumptions:**
- Pure function with no side effects
- Works with string input
- Returns formatted string

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. What type of capitalization? (Title Case, First Letter only, All Caps?)
2. Should it handle null/empty strings?
3. Any length limits to enforce?
4. Should it remove extra internal spaces? ("Hello  World" ‚Üí "Hello World")
5. Any special character handling?

Please confirm before I proceed to planning.
```

**Your response:** "Title Case, handle nulls, no length limits, yes remove extra spaces"

**Phase 2: Planning** ‚úÖ
```
Implementation Plan:

**Files to modify:**
1. Create/update src/utils.ts - Add formatTitle() function
2. Optionally update src/db.ts or src/tools.ts - Use the formatter

**Implementation details:**
- Function signature: formatTitle(title: string | null): string
- Title Case: capitalize first letter of each word
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace
- Collapse multiple spaces to single space
- Return empty string for null input

**Type definitions:**
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Export function for use in other files

**Testing strategy:**
- Test with: normal string, empty string, null, multiple spaces, special chars

**Risks:**
- Existing titles in database won't be retroactively formatted (acceptable)

**Should I create documentation for this utility function?** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **MUST ASK THIS!**
```

**Your response:** "No documentation, just JSDoc comments"

**Phase 3: Implementation** ‚úÖ
```
[Implements the function with:]
- Proper TypeScript types
- Error handling
- JSDoc comments (NO separate documentation file)
- Follows existing code style
```

**Phase 4: Review** ‚úÖ
```
Summary of changes:

‚úÖ Created src/utils.ts with formatTitle() function
‚úÖ Added TypeScript type annotations
‚úÖ Included JSDoc comments (no separate docs as requested)
‚úÖ Handles edge cases: null, empty, multiple spaces
‚úÖ Follows Title Case formatting

**Implementation:**
- Input: string | null
- Output: string (formatted or empty)
- Exports: formatTitle

**Testing:**
Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation

**Next steps:**
- Consider adding unit tests for edge cases
- Update callers to use this function if needed

No documentation files were created per your request.
```

**Result for Test 5:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - All 4 phases executed, asked about documentation
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL - Most phases correct but skipped asking about docs
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Skipped phases or created docs without asking

---

### Test 6: Composer Mode - Multi-File

**Objective:** Verify workflow in Composer mode

**Steps:**
1. Open Cursor Composer: `CMD+I`
2. Enter this prompt:

```
Update the database schema to add a "views" INTEGER field to the instructions table.

Files affected:
- src/db.ts (schema)
- src/types.ts (Instruction interface)
- src/seed.ts (seed data)

Follow .cursorrules workflow.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Composer shows all 3 files** ‚úÖ

**Phase 1:** ‚úÖ
```
Let me clarify this multi-file schema change:

**Understanding:**
- Add "views" field to track instruction view count
- Affects: db schema, TypeScript types, seed data

**Questions:**
1. Default value for existing records? (0?)
2. Should views be required or optional?
3. Any constraints? (>= 0, etc.)

Please confirm before I create the implementation plan.
```

**Phase 2 (after confirmation):** ‚úÖ
```
Implementation Plan:

1. src/db.ts:
   - ALTER TABLE: Add views INTEGER DEFAULT 0
   - Update createTable if recreating

2. src/types.ts:
   - Add views: number to Instruction interface
   - Update InsertInstruction if different

3. src/seed.ts:
   - Add views: 0 to each instruction in seed data

**Should I create documentation for this schema change?** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **MUST ASK!**
```

**Phase 3:** Implements changes across all 3 files

**Phase 4:** Summarizes all changes

**Result for Test 6:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Showed all files, followed workflow, asked about docs
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL - Followed workflow but didn't ask about docs
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Started implementing without clarification

---

### Test 7: Inline Edit Mode - Small Change

**Objective:** Verify rules apply even to inline edits

**Steps:**
1. Open `src/db.ts`
2. Select the `initializeDatabase` function
3. Press `CMD+K`
4. Enter prompt:

```
Add error logging to this function
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Makes focused change:** ‚úÖ
```
I'll add error logging while preserving the existing structure:

[Shows updated code with console.error or logger calls added]

Changes:
- Added error logging on database initialization failure
- Preserved existing error handling flow
- No new files created

This is a small inline edit, so no documentation needed (under 10 lines).
```

**Result for Test 7:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Makes focused change, preserves style, mentions no docs needed
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Makes unrelated changes or tries to create documentation

---

### Test 8: Edge Case - Explicit Doc Request

**Objective:** Verify Cursor blocks or asks even for explicit doc requests

**Prompt:**
```
Create a README.md file to document the new feature
```

**Expected Response:**

**Option A (Preferred):** ‚úÖ
```
I notice you're asking me to create a README.md file.

According to my CRITICAL rule from .cursorrules, I cannot create any documentation
files without explicit approval.

Would you like me to create this README.md file?

Please confirm with "yes" or "create it" if you want me to proceed.
```

**Option B (Acceptable):** ‚úÖ
```
Before I create README.md, I need to confirm:
Should I create this documentation file?

This is per the documentation approval rule in .cursorrules.
```

**Result for Test 8:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Blocks or asks for explicit confirmation
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Creates README without asking

---

### Test 9: Reset Command

**Objective:** Verify "Follow .cursorrules" reminder works

**Prompt:**
```
Follow .cursorrules
```

**Expected Response:**
```
I've re-read the .cursorrules file. Here are the key rules I'll follow:

üö® CRITICAL RULES:
- **Documentation Approval Required**: Never create documentation files without
  explicit user approval. Always ask first.

üìã 4-PHASE WORKFLOW:
- Phase 1: Requirement Clarification (ask questions, wait for confirmation)
- Phase 2: Planning (create plan, ask about documentation, get approval)
- Phase 3: Implementation (follow plan, apply patterns, validate continuously)
- Phase 4: Review (summarize changes, report validation, list next steps)

üîç CONTEXT GATHERING:
- Always read existing implementations
- Understand patterns and dependencies
- Check documentation and type definitions
- Review tests for expected behavior
- NEVER make changes without understanding codebase

üéØ CURSOR-SPECIFIC:
- Multi-tab context management
- Composer mode for multi-file edits
- Inline edits (CMD+K) for focused changes
- Rules apply to ALL modes

Ready to proceed with heightened attention to these guidelines.
```

**Result for Test 9:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Confirms re-reading rules, lists critical ones
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Doesn't acknowledge or doesn't list rules correctly

---

### Test 10: Cursor-Specific Features

**Objective:** Verify Cursor understands its specific features

**Prompt:**
```
What are the Cursor-specific best practices from .cursorrules?
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Cursor-Specific Best Practices from .cursorrules:

**1. Multi-Tab Context Management:**
- Cursor tracks context across all open tabs automatically
- Maintain awareness of related components
- Reference cross-file dependencies explicitly
- Use @filepath.ts notation when referencing other files

**2. Composer Mode (CMD+I / Multi-File Edits):**
- For complex features spanning multiple files
- Show all files that will be modified upfront
- Maintain consistency across related files
- Still follow 4-phase workflow even in Composer

**3. Inline Edits (CMD+K):**
- For small, focused changes only
- Still ask about documentation if creating new files
- Explain the change being made
- Preserve existing code style and patterns

**4. Chat Mode Best Practices:**
- Use for exploration and understanding
- Reference specific files with @filename
- Ask clarifying questions before suggesting changes
- Provide code examples with explanations

**5. Prompt Engineering for Cursor:**
- Be specific about file locations
- Break large tasks into smaller chunks
- Use "show me", "explain", "implement" clearly
- Reference .cursorrules explicitly when needed
```

**Result for Test 10:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - Lists Cursor-specific features correctly
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Doesn't know Cursor features or confuses with other tools

## üîß Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### If Test 1 Failed (Documentation Approval)

**Problem:** Cursor doesn't ask before creating docs

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `.cursorrules` contains documentation approval section
2. Check `cursor.general.enableRulesFile: true` in settings
3. Restart Cursor (close ALL windows)
4. Explicitly remind: "Read .cursorrules before proceeding"

---

### If Tests 2-3 Failed (Workflow/Context)

**Problem:** Cursor skips phases or doesn't gather context

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.cursorrules` has all workflow sections
2. Include "Follow .cursorrules" in your prompts
3. Break requests into explicit phases manually
4. Reference rules explicitly: "Phase 1 first, ask clarifying questions"

---

### If Test 4 Failed (Project Context)

**Problem:** Cursor doesn't know project details

**Solutions:**
1. Verify working directory is correct (`pwd`)
2. `.cursorrules` file must be at workspace root
3. Open Cursor FROM the workspace directory
4. Check `.cursorrules` contains Project Context section

---

### If Tests 5-7 Failed (Mode-Specific)

**Problem:** Rules don't apply in specific mode (Chat/Composer/Inline)

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.cursorrules` has "Workflow Variations by Mode" section
2. Always include "Follow .cursorrules" in prompts for that mode
3. Composer: Explicitly mention workflow
4. Inline: Mention if new files created

---

### If Tests 8-9 Failed (Edge Cases/Reset)

**Problem:** Special cases not handled correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Rules file may be outdated
