## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Our software ecosystem consists of multiple microservices built on different technology stacks (Java 21, Erlang 27, Python 3, Node.js) that need unified observability for:
- Request flow tracking across service boundaries
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Root cause analysis for failures
- Service dependency mapping

### Solution
Implement **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger** as our distributed tracing solution, providing:
- Standardized tracing across all languages
- Real-time trace visualization
- Service performance metrics
- Integration with existing infrastructure (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Instrumentation | OpenTelemetry SDKs | Collect traces from applications |
| Collector | OpenTelemetry Collector | Aggregate and process traces |
| Backend | Jaeger | Store and query traces |
| Storage | Elasticsearch/Cassandra | Trace data persistence |
| Message Queue | Kafka | Buffer traces during high load |
| UI | Jaeger UI | Visualize and analyze traces |

### Key Benefits

1. **Unified Observability**: Single pane of glass for all services
2. **Language Agnostic**: Works with Java, Erlang, Python, Node.js
3. **Vendor Neutral**: No lock-in, can switch backends
4. **Industry Standard**: CNCF-backed, future-proof
5. **Auto-instrumentation**: Minimal code changes required
6. **Production Ready**: Battle-tested at scale

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | Infrastructure setup (Jaeger, Collector, Storage) |
| Phase 2 | 3 weeks | Pilot implementation (2-3 critical services) |
| Phase 3 | 6 weeks | Gradual rollout to all services |
| Phase 4 | 2 weeks | Optimization and fine-tuning |

### Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 100% of microservices instrumented
- **Performance Impact**: <1% latency overhead
- **Adoption**: 80% of teams actively using traces for debugging
- **MTTR Reduction**: 40% reduction in Mean Time To Resolution
