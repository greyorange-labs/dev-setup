## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Migration Approach

**Strategy**: **Big Bang Infrastructure + Phased Service Rollout**

- **Infrastructure**: Deploy all tracing infrastructure at once (2 weeks)
- **Services**: Gradual service instrumentation over 8 weeks

### 1.2 Timeline

```
Week 1-2   │ Infrastructure Setup
Week 3-4   │ Pilot Services (Critical Path)
Week 5-6   │ High-Traffic Services
Week 7-8   │ Remaining Services
Week 9-10  │ Optimization & Training
───────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────
           │
Phase 1    │ Phase 2      │ Phase 3     │ Phase 4
```

### 1.3 Team Allocation

| Role | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| DevOps/SRE | 2 FTE | 1 FTE | 0.5 FTE | 0.25 FTE |
| Backend Devs | 0 | 4 FTE | 4 FTE | 2 FTE |
| QA Engineers | 0 | 1 FTE | 1 FTE | 0.5 FTE |
| Tech Lead | 0.5 FTE | 0.5 FTE | 0.25 FTE | 0.25 FTE |

## 2. Risk Assessment

### 2.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Performance degradation** | Medium | High | Gradual rollout, monitoring, quick rollback |
| **Infrastructure instability** | Low | High | Extensive testing, HA setup, Kafka buffering |
| **Incomplete traces** | Medium | Medium | Context propagation testing, validation |
| **Storage overflow** | Low | High | ILM policies, monitoring, alerts |
| **Team adoption failure** | Medium | Medium | Training, documentation, champions |
| **Cost overrun** | Low | Medium | Budget tracking, optimization |
| **Data privacy issues** | Low | High | PII scrubbing, access controls |
| **Service discovery issues** | Low | Low | DNS testing, K8s service mesh |

### 2.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Performance Degradation
```
Prevention:
- Start with 100% sampling at app, filter at collector
- Use async span export
- Batch aggressively
- Monitor latency metrics

Detection:
- Automated performance tests
- SLA monitoring
- User-facing latency alerts

Response:
- Immediate rollback capability
- Feature flags to disable tracing
- Scale collector resources
```

#### Infrastructure Instability
```
Prevention:
- HA deployment (3+ replicas)
- Kafka buffering
- Resource limits & requests
- Health checks

Detection:
- Prometheus alerts
- Log monitoring
- Synthetic checks

Response:
- Auto-scaling
- Runbook for common issues
- 24/7 on-call rotation
```

### 2.3 Rollback Triggers

Automatically rollback if:
- [ ] Service latency increases >5% for 10 minutes
- [ ] Error rate increases >2% for 5 minutes
- [ ] OTel Collector CPU >90% sustained
- [ ] Elasticsearch disk >95%
- [ ] Kafka lag >1 million messages

    # Wait for trace to be ingested
    sleep 10

    # Query Jaeger API
    TRACE=$(curl -s "http://jaeger-query:16686/api/traces/${TRACE_ID}")

    # Validate trace has expected services
    echo $TRACE | jq '.data[0].spans | map(.process.serviceName) | unique' | \

# Initialize tracing
provider = TracerProvider()
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://otel-collector:4317")
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Create root span for batch job
with tracer.start_as_current_span("daily_report_generation") as span:
    span.set_attribute("job.type", "batch")
    span.set_attribute("job.schedule", "daily")

    # Process records
    for record in records:
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_record") as record_span:

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Test Levels

#### Level 1: Unit Tests (Developer)
```java
@Test
public void testSpanCreation() {
    Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("test-operation").startSpan();
    span.setAttribute("test.key", "test.value");
    span.end();

    // Verify span was created (mock or test exporter)
    assertThat(exportedSpans).hasSize(1);
    assertThat(exportedSpans.get(0).getName()).isEqualTo("test-operation");
}
```

#### Level 2: Integration Tests (QA)
```python
def test_end_to_end_trace():
    # Generate request with trace context
    headers = {'traceparent': '00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01'}
    response = requests.post('http://api/orders', json=order_data, headers=headers)

    # Wait for trace propagation
    time.sleep(5)

    # Query Jaeger for trace
    trace = query_jaeger_trace('0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c')

    # Verify expected spans
    assert 'api-gateway' in trace.services
    assert 'order-service' in trace.services
    assert 'inventory-service' in trace.services
    assert len(trace.spans) >= 10
```

#### Level 3: Performance Tests
```bash
# Before instrumentation
ab -n 10000 -c 100 https://api.com/test > before.txt

# After instrumentation
ab -n 10000 -c 100 https://api.com/test > after.txt

# Compare (should be <1% difference)
python compare_perf.py before.txt after.txt
```

#### Level 4: Chaos Tests
```yaml
# Chaos Engineering: OTel Collector failure
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: collector-failure
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - observability
    labelSelectors:
      app: otel-collector-gateway
  scheduler:
    cron: "*/10 * * * *"  # Kill one pod every 10 minutes

# Verify: Services continue to function, traces buffer in Kafka
```

### 5.2 Test Checklist per Service

- [ ] Logs correlated with traces (trace ID present)

---

## 6. Rollback Procedures

### 6.1 Service-Level Rollback

**Trigger**: Service experiencing issues after instrumentation

**Procedure**:

```bash
# Option 1: Disable tracing via environment variable
kubectl set env deployment/myservice OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true -n production

# Option 2: Remove Java agent (requires redeploy)
kubectl set env deployment/myservice JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="" -n production
kubectl rollout restart deployment/myservice -n production

# Option 3: Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myservice -n production

# Verify
kubectl rollout status deployment/myservice -n production
```

**Timeline**: 2-5 minutes

### 6.2 Infrastructure Rollback

**Trigger**: Widespread issues with tracing infrastructure

**Procedure**:

```bash
# Emergency: Stop all collectors (stops ingestion)
kubectl scale deployment/otel-collector-gateway --replicas=0 -n observability
kubectl delete daemonset/otel-collector-agent -n observability

# Services continue to function (traces dropped, buffered in app memory)
# Applications will log warnings but continue processing

# Timeline: 30 seconds
```

### 6.3 Partial Rollback

**Scenario**: Keep infrastructure, disable tracing for subset of services

**Procedure**:

```bash
# Create ConfigMap with service allow-list
kubectl create configmap tracing-allowlist \
  --from-literal=enabled-services="service-a,service-b,service-c" \
  -n observability

# Update OTel Collector to filter by service name
# (requires collector config change)

# Or: Use feature flags
kubectl set env deployment/service-d TRACING_ENABLED=false
```

### 6.4 Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue | Severity | Affected Services | Action | Timeline |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Single service latency +2% | Low | 1 | Investigate, may continue | N/A |
| Single service latency +10% | Medium | 1 | Disable tracing for service | 5 min |
| Multiple services latency +5% | High | 5+ | Scale collectors, investigate | 10 min |
| Infrastructure outage | Critical | All | Stop collectors, investigate | 2 min |
| Data privacy breach | Critical | Any | Stop all, audit, remediate | Immediate |
